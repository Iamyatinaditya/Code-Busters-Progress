                  <p>
                      
                    COVID-19 affects people of all ages, although morbidity and death are many times greater in adults, especially those over the age of 50. Asymptomatic or mild infection affects children. The standard procedure is to analyse any new vaccination in an older population first, then reduce the age group to assess the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in children. So yet, none of the currently available vaccinations have been tested in children. The efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccinations in children are now being tested in clinical studies.

                <button class="accordion">How are vaccines such as covishield made?</button>

                <div class="panel">

                  <p>Covishield is made up of Inactivated adenovirus containing Coronavirus segments, Aluminium Hydroxide Gel, L-Histidine, L-Histidine Hydrochloride Monohydrate, Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate, Polysorbate 80, Ethanol, Sucrose, Sodium Chloride, and Disodium Edetate Dihydrate are all ingredients in Covishield (EDTA). Inactivated Coronavirus, Aluminum Hydroxide Gel, TLR 7/8 Agonist, 2-Phenoxyethanol, and Phosphate Buffered Saline [NKA1] are all ingredients in Covaxin.

                <button class="accordion">Which vaccine is better between Covisheild and Covaxin?</button>

                <div class="panel">

                  <p>There is no head-to-head comparison of the two vaccinations used in India, thus there is no way to choose between them. Both would be effective in avoiding infection as well as a person's sickness progressing to a severe stage. It would have the long-term benefit of avoiding death in the elderly and those with comorbidities. </p>

                <button class="accordion">If one is taking medicines for illnesses like Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension etc., or if they are suffering from HTN/DM/CKD/heart disease/lipid disorders etc., can he/she take the COVID-19 vaccine safely?</button>

                <div class="panel">

                  <p>Yes, people with one or more of these conditions/diseases are considered among the high-risk category. And it is necessary for them to get COVID-19 vaccination. Overall, the vaccine is safe and efficacious in adults with certain diseases. The maximum benefit of getting the COVID-19 vaccine is for those who have such conditions. However, if you are concerned for any specific reason, please consult your doctor for a better perspective.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Can a person presently having COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected) infection be vaccinated?</button>

                <div class="panel">

                  <p>Anyone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of spreading the same to other people present at  the vaccination site. For this reason, infected individuals should defer vaccination for 14 days after symptoms resolution.</p>

                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Is it necessary for someone who has recovered from COVID-19 to take the vaccine? If I had gotten COVID-19 and had recovered, why should I take the vaccine?</button>

                <div class="panel">

                    <p>Yes, it is advisable to receive complete the schedule of COVID-19 vaccine irrespective of previous history of infection with COVID-19. This will surely help in developing a strong immune system response against this disease. Development of immunity or duration of protection after COVID-19 exposure is not created therefore it is highly recommended to receive vaccine even after the exposure of COVID-19 infection. It is recommended to wait for 4-8 weeks after recovery from COVID symptoms before getting the vaccine.</p>

                  <button class="accordion">Does India have the capacity to store the COVID-19 vaccine at temperature of +2 to +8 degree Celsius and transport them at required temperature?</button>

                 <div class="panel">

                    <p> India has one of the world's largest immunisation programmes, with over 26 million babies and 29 million pregnant women receiving vaccinations. To efficiently cater to the country's enormous and diversified population, programme mechanisms are being strengthened/geared up.</p>
  
                  </div>

                  <button class="accordion">Out of the multiple vaccines available, how is one or more vaccine chosen for administration?</button>

                 <div class="panel">

                    <p> Before obtaining a licence for a vaccine candidate, our country's drug agency examines the safety and effectiveness data from clinical studies. As a result, any COVID-19 vaccines that are licenced will have similar safety and effectiveness. However, because various COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable, it must be guaranteed that just one kind of vaccine is used to complete the whole immunisation regimen.</p>

                  <button class="accordion">Does this vaccine provide herd immunity?</button>

                 <div class="panel">

                    <p> When a large number of people in a community get vaccinated, herd immunity develops, providing indirect protection. With each illness, the percentage of persons who must be immune in order to acquire herd immunity varies. For example, 95 percent of the population must be vaccinated against measles to begin producing herd immunity, while the proportion of the population that must be immunised against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is unknown.</p>

                  <button class="accordion">Is it important for me to receive the same vaccine during second dose?</button>

                 <div class="panel">

                    <p>Because the vaccinations are not interchangeable, it's critical to get the second dosage of the same vaccine as the first. In addition, the Co-WIN site will aid in ensuring that everyone receives the same vaccine.</p>
