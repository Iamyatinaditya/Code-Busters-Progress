                <div class="panel">

                  <p>COVID-19 spreads when an infected individual exhales virus-containing droplets and extremely minute particles. Other individuals may inhale these droplets and particles, or they may settle on their eyes, noses, or mouths. They may contaminate surfaces they come into contact with in some cases. People who are within 6 feet of an infected person are most likely to contract the disease. <br><br>
                      The main ways in which COVID 19 spreads are: <br><br>
                    ·         When near an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles containing the virus, inhaling air. <br>
                    ·         Having virus-carrying droplets and particles land in the eyes, nose, or mouth, particularly through splashes and sprays such as a cough or <br>
                    ·         Touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with virus-infected hands. <br>

                <div class="panel">

                  <p>People afflicted with the virus have spread across a community, including some who are unsure how or where they were infected. Depending on local factors, each health agency assesses community spread in a different way. Please check your local health department's website for information on community spread in your region.

                  <p>Handwashing is one of the most effective methods to keep yourself and your family healthy. After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the restroom; and before eating or preparing food, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren't readily available.</p>

                  <p>COVID-19 can make children unwell if they are infected with the virus that causes it. The majority of children with COVID-19 exhibit little symptoms or none at all and there is a term for that which is “Asymptomatic” COVID-19 has caused less illnesses in children than in adults.</p>
