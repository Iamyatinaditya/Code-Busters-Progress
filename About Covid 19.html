        <h2> <b style="color: rgb(11, 17, 109);">COVID 19</b> </h2>
        <h4>On the 31st of December, the World Health Organization was notified of instances of pneumonia with an unknown origin in Wuhan, China. On January 7, 2020, Chinese officials discovered a new coronavirus as the culprit, which was given the temporary designation "2019-nCoV."
            Coronaviruses (CoV) are a broad group of viruses that may cause everything from a typical cold to more serious illnesses. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has never been seen in humans before. The novel virus was given the name "COVID-19 virus" after that.</h4>
        
        <h2><b style="color: rgb(11, 17, 109);">The various COVID-19 Variants</b></h2>

   
        
        <h4>Viruses are continually evolving due to mutation. A variation of the original virus is one that has one or more additional mutations.
        </h4>


        <h3><b style="color: rgb(23, 160, 23);">Delta Variant:</b></h3>
        <h4>This variety is approximately twice as infectious than previous versions, and it has the potential to cause more serious sickness. Unvaccinated persons are at the greatest risk of infection. Vaccine breakout infections can occur in people who have been completely vaccinated and disseminate the virus to others. Vaccinated persons, on the other hand, appear to disseminate COVID-19 over a shorter amount of time than unvaccinated ones. Despite evidence that COVID-19 vaccinations are significantly less effective against the delta form, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines appear to give protection against severe COVID-19.</h4>
   
    

        <h3><b style="color: rgb(37, 165, 37);">Omicron Variant:</b></h3>
        <h4>This variety may spread more quickly than others, such as delta. However, it is unclear if omicron promotes more severe illness. People who have been completely vaccinated are prone to develop breakthrough infections and transfer the virus to others. The COVID-19 vaccinations, on the other hand, are likely to be useful in avoiding serious disease. Some monoclonal antibody therapies are also less successful as a result of this variation.</h4>
        <h3> <b style="color: rgb(23, 160, 23);"> Other Variants </b> </h3>

        <h4>The alpha, gamma, and beta versions are still being tracked, albeit at considerably lower levels in the United States. The mu variation is also being kept an eye on.</h4>

            Get immunised as soon as possible and follow local vaccine recommendations. <br><br>
            
            Maintain a physical distance of at least 1 metre between yourself and others, even if they don't appear to be unwell.  <br><br>
            
            Crowds and direct touch should be avoided. <br><br>
            
            When physical separation isn't possible and the environment isn't well ventilated, put on a well fitting mask. <br><br>

            Frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. <br><br>

            When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue. Used tissues should be disposed of quickly, and hands should be cleaned on a regular basis. <br><br>

            Self-isolate until you recover if you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19.
